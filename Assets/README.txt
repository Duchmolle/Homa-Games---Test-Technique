Welcome to Road To Success!

In this game you will build your fame by traveling the long road to success!
Be careful, however, the world of music is not easy, beware of scandals!

Put your talents as a singer / songwriter to good use!

Scoring explanation:
- Pick up a music note = +20 points
- Pick up a spotlight = +1 to score multiplier
- Pick up a newspaper = -1 to the score multiplier
- During the solo, each target destroyed = +1 to the multiplier

Parts of the code that can be reused:
- PlayerStateMachine: A state machine that allows you to have precise control over the behavior of animations
- SwipeDetector: A script that detects if the user swipes up, down, left or right
- PlayerMove: A move script using transform and finger movement on the screen to move the character left or right
- ColorRandomisr: A script that allows you to give random colors on the instantiation of the object on which it is placed

I chose to move the character through the transform because I don't use physics in any feature and 
the character movement had to be more reactive than realistic. 
I also chose to put a sort of "mini map" at the top of the UI to recall a score or guitar strings, 
as if we were walking on it. The symbols on the black bars are there as a nod to Rhythm Games genre.
